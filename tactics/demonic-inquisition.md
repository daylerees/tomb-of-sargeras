- [**Bone Scythe**]() causes melee attacks to apply **2** torment.

- [**Unbearable Torment**]() happens when hitting 100% torment, and nerfs damage, healing, and increases damage taken while reducing hit chance. Remove / reduce torment by picking up orbs in the cage room. Use extra action button to enter/exit the cage room.
- [**Calcified Quills**]() will cause the melee add to fire a wide shockwave attack at a player. Anyone in the path will take damage and be knocked into the air. This ability often targets the tank.
- [**Bone Saw**]() causes the melee attack to whirlwind. Avoid the mob and switch quickly to the ranged add to avoid building torment.
- [**Pangs of Guilt**]() causes strong raid wide damage if not interrupted. Make an interrupt rotation (3x), and account for people going into the cage room.
- [**Suffocating Dark**]() targets 3 ranged players with a void zone. The zone slows and deals damage and torment. Move out as soon as possible. Try not to stand near the entrance of the room (where people exit the cage).
- [**Echoing Anguish**]() is a debuff with explosion on drop applied to random players. Spread at least 8 yards from other players.
- [**Fel Squall**]() ability should trigger all DPS to move to the melee mob to avoid extra torment. Swap to the other add ***before*** this ability is cast.
