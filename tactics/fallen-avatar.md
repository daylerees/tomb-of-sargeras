# Fallen Avatar

## Normal

### General

- Two phase fight.
- Try to extend phase 1 as long as possible.
- The boss will enter phase 2 at **100%** energy.

#### Phase 1

- [**Desolate**]() deals damage to the tank, and increases damage taken by desolate by 75% for 29 seconds. Tank swap on two stacks.
- [**Ripple of Darkness**]() does raid-wide ticking damage when the boss isn't being tanked. Make sure the tanks move back to the boss as soon as possible after proximity abilities.

#### Phase 2

- Still tank swap.
- [**Sear**]() does ticking raid-damage when the boss is in the lava. So keep him away from it.
- Keep the boss in the corner of the platform at all time. He will break away the floor, so try to keep as little from disappearing as possible.

- [**Unbound Chaos**]() might be the move to use healer cooldowns on.

#### Phase 1

- [**Containment Pylon**]() shoots a beam towards the boss. Block the beam with the 'Maiden of Valor' add. She will gain energy instead. Try not to deal more than 25% damage to her between shield phases (see next).
- [**Cleansing Protocol**]() is used by the Maiden at full energy. It's a shielded cast. Break the shield before the end of the cast and interrupt her or wipe the raid.
- [**Consume**]() is cast by the boss in phase two if the maiden is alive, causing him to gain her remaining health. Make sure she is dead before phase two.
- [**Touch of Sargeras**]() is a purple circle in the room. At least three people need to stand inside it before it explodes. Immunities work. Spread the raid across the room to make this easier.
- [**Unbound Chaos**]() causes ticking damage and green pools on the floor. Dodge them.
- [**Shadowy Blades**]() beams a blue laser at a player. They need to move to the edge/back of the room where a pool will be left under them. Other people should get out of the laser's path. Other players can't see the laser. Look at the shards instead.
- [**Rupture Realities**]() does proximity based damage. Move as far away from the boss as possible.

#### Phase 2

- [**Black Winds**]() will suck whirlwinds into the boss. Dodge them.
- [**Dark Mark**]() is the same as the [**Touch of Sargeras**]() circles from phase one. Share the damage.

## Heroic
