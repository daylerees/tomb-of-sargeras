# Maiden of Vigilance

## Normal

### General

- Two phase fight. Focused on the raid being split with two debuffs, **Holy** (yellow) + **Fel** (green).
- Use markers (triangle + star) to show group locations.

- Tank the boss with a tank either side. Players should stack on the side matching the tanks buff. Forming two groups of players separated by Fel and Holy buffs.
- [**Hammer of Creation**]() is a holy-based shared frontal cone ability. The boss should be turned to face the holy side. Move out of the patch on the floor once cast.
- [**Hammer of Obliteration**]() is the same as the holy frontal cone, but this time it's fel-powered. Make sure this move faces the fel group.

- Consider keeping cooldowns for the second phase. This could be the heavy damage segment.

#### Phase 1

- At the start of the fight each player will receive either Fel or Holy buff. Taking damage relating to the opposite type, will do heavy damage through a debuff called [**Unstable Soul**]().
- To avoid this debuff, don't go near players with the other buff. Instead, stack in two groups on the coloured markers. Fel on green, and holy on yellow.
- [**Unstable Soul**]() is a ticking debuff gained from any cross-buff error during the fight. When the timer has **1.5 seconds** left, (roughly 1/6 of the bomb circle) then you need to jump into the hole.
- [**Light Remanence**]() makes a swirly holy circle on the floor. Move away from it before it explodes.
- [**Fel Echo Bolts**]() makes a swirly fel circle on the floor. Move away from it before it explodes.

#### Phase 2

- [**Wrath of the Creators**]() does ticking damage each time a wave comes out from the boss.
- She sends out orbs of two colours on tracks similar to games like Audiosurf.
- Move through orbs the same colour as your fel or holy buff while making your way to the boss. Try to stay as grouped up as possible.
- You need to get to the boss as soon as possible to DPS her shield down.
- Once the shield is down, interrupt the boss and the first phase starts again dealing new buffs.
