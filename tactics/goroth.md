# Goroth

## Normal

### General

- It's a Skorpyron-style line-of-sight mechanic fight.

- Tank him at the edge of the middle of the room. Don't bother moving him. It will make it easier to manipulate the position of the spikes.
- [**Burning Armor**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=231363/burning-armor) should be tank-swapped on a single application. It will put a big green circle around you that you need to keep away from players.

- [**Shattering Star**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=233279/shattering-star) the big rolling ball, does huge raid-wide damage when it hits the target. The number of pillars it hits on the way will reduce this.

- [**Infernal Spikes**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=233021/infernal-spike) will case swirly puddles under players which when complete will form a large spike (like the pillars on Tichondrius). Make sure to move out of the puddle. We could also try to stand in places beforehand where the pillars might be placed in a line.
- [**Infernal Burning**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=233062/infernal-burning) performs a fel move on all players. To survive, you must line of sight the boss behind an infernal spike.
- [**Crashing Comet**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=230345/crashing-comet) places a green swirly circle under the feet of the players. It follows you, kind of like the runes on Tichondrius. Keep this away from all other players, and away from the pillars too.
- [**Shattering Star**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=233279/shattering-star) targets a specific player (also points an arrow on the floor to him) and then after a second or so, will throw a huge ball of fell at them. You need to get the ball to travel through ***at least*** one pillar (more is better, all is bad) before it hits you. You cannot dodge the ball. Make sure no one else is in the way.

## Heroic

- [**Fel Eruption**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=234346/fel-eruption) covers quarter of the room in fire. Need to move the boss from this. Need players spread out in the room to ensure there are pillars in every area, to cover for a quarter being inaccessible.
