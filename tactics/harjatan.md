## Normal

### General

- Tank the boss near a murloc spawn location.
- [**Jagged Abrasion**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=231998/jagged-abrasion) is a stacking dot from melee hits. Swap at around **4-6** stacks.
- [**Unchecked Rage**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=231854/unchecked-rage) is a frontal shockwave cast at **100%** energy. Face the raid to share damage.
- [**Commanding Roar**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=232192/commanding-roar) causes the boss to summon murlocs. Pick them up and stack on boss. Face away from raid.

- [**Draw In**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=232061/draw-in) completion gives the boss a debuff that will cause melee attacks to do raid wide damage. You might want to use a cooldown here.

- [**Unchecked Rage**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=231854/unchecked-rage) is a shared damage attack, so stack right behind the boss as much as possible.
- [**Commanding Roar**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=232192/commanding-roar) causes the boss to summon murlocs. Kill them all. Focus wave mender.
- [**Driven Assault**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=234128/driven-assault) causes murlocs to focus a player. Kite them.
- [**Watery Splash**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=233371/watery-splash) is a heal cast by the wave mender murloc. Be sure to interrupt this.
- [**Aqueous Burst**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=231729/aqueous-burst) is a **6 second** debuff which leaves a pool of drenching waters when it expires. Leave away from the raid. Try to overlap in round.. triangle... shapes.
- [**Draw In**](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=232061/draw-in) pulls all pools of drench into him, Nythendra style. Avoid them! Spread out after, so new pools are dropped in good positions.

## Heroic

- Darkscale taskmaster is an extra add that needs to me tanked away from adds and the boss. You can side-step out of his breath account.
