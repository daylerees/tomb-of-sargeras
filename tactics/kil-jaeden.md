#### Phase 1

- [**Shadow Reflections**]() debuffs three random players. Spread apart. Add with spawn on expiration. Stacking **might** work.
- [**Rupturing Singularity**]() is a purple falling orb meteor. Stand close, but not inside. You will take a knockback. Try to face a corner on the first.
- [**Armageddon**]() causes orange swirly pools, lots of little ones and one big one. Soak these. Someone with immunity / stronkness should soak the big one. Multiple people otherwise. Maybe use a tank? Lots of ideas here. Try not to soak it twice in a row, as it leaves a debuff which stacks. However, don't let any hit the ground!

#### Intermission (80%)

- [**Bursting Dreadflame**]() targets random players with an AoE. Spread away from others.
- [**Focused Dreadflame**]() targets a player (red arrow). All others need to get between them and the boss and soak the damage. Try to be 5yds apart in the beam.

#### Phase 2

- [**Shadow Reflections**]() extra add in this phase on the tank. Will cast [**Sorrowful Wail**](). Maybe move this away from players. Unclear.

#### Intermission (40%)

- Platform goes dark. Can't target anyone (inc friendlies) unless they are within 8yds. Find Illidan and talk to him, then kill all the hidden mobs that spawn. Move as a group or split into two maybe? Will have to see.

#### Phase 3

- [**Darkness of a Thousand Souls**]() requires players to stand near portals so that bolts get sucked up.
- [**Flaming Orb**]() should be kited as far as possible away from other players.
- [**Tear Rift/Gravity Squeeze**]() will happen when close to a portal. Don't be near it unless targetted by bolts.
- [**Demonic Obelisk**]() will spawn in the play field. Avoid it, and the lines that form from it.
- [**Bursting Dreadflame**]() and [**Focused Dreadflame**]() are back.

## Heroic

- N/A
