#### All Phases

- [**Burden of Pain**]() is a debuff which redirects physical damage taken to the raid. Taunt on one.
- [**From The Abyss**]() summons three abyss stalker adds. Offtank (with burden) should tank these. They deal shadow damage not melee.

#### All Phases

- [**Dark Depths**]() is cast by the Abyss stalker adds and should be interrupted.
- [**Concealing Murk**]() is left by the Abyss stalker adds on death. Green puddle. Move out of it.
- [**Hydra Shot**]() targets three players (green arrows). They should spread apart, and other raid members should stand in between the boss and the marked players to spread the damage taken. Off tank should avoid taking damage here.

#### Phase 1

- [**Slicing Tornado**]() causes a wall of tornados to travel across the room. Dodge them to avoid getting a dot. They will slow down on the Concealing Murk. Need to kill the adds just before this wall.
- [**Consuming Hunger**]() is a ticking dot. Get hit by a jellyfish to remove it.
- [**Thundering Shock**]() is a circle with a Jellyfish in it. Get out. If you get hit it will spawn a murloc which should be stunned/interrupted and killed.

#### Phase 2 (70%)

- [**Call Vellius**]() will make a line across the room. Get out before a fish hits you.
- [**Call Ossunet**]() will cause ink patches on the floor. Stay out of them. They will slow you.
- [**Beckon Sarukel**]() pick up the ink patches, and run them to the whale. Everyone else should keep away.

#### Phase 3 (30%)

- [**Slicing Tornado**]()s are back!
- [**Consuming Hunger**]() is back, but there's no jellyfish to remove it. So a soft enrage.
- [**Call Vellius**]() is in this phase.
- [**Call Ossunet**]() is also back, but no whale.

## Heroic

- N/A
